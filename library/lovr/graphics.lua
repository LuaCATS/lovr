---### NOTE:
---The format table can contain a list of `FieldType`s or a list of tables to provide extra information about each field.
---
---Each inner table has the following keys:
---
---- `type` is the `FieldType` of the field and is required.
---- `offset` is the byte offset of the field.
---
---Any fields with a `nil` offset will be placed next

---  In practice this means that you probably want to provide an `offset` for either all of the
---  fields or none of them.
---- `location` is the vertex attribute location of each field.
---
---This is used to match up each
---  field with an attribute declared in a shader, and doesn't have any purpose when binding the
---  buffer as a uniform or storage buffer.
---
---Any fields with a `nil` location will use an

---
---Named locations are not currently supported, but
---  may be added in the future.

---
---It is not currently possible to get the version of the driver, although this could be added.
---
---Regarding multiple GPUs: If OpenXR is enabled, the OpenXR runtime has control over which GPU is used, which ensures best compatibility with the VR headset.

---
---A Buffer is a block of GPU memory.
---
---Buffers are similar to Lua tables or arrays: they have a length and store a list of values.
---
---The length of a Buffer and its format (the type of each value) are declared upfront and can't be changed.
---
---Each value of a Buffer consists of one or more fields, and each field has a type.
---
---For example, if a Buffer is used to store vertices, each value might store 3 fields for the position, normal vector, and UV coordinates of a vertex.
---
---Buffers are commonly used for:
---
---- Mesh data: Buffers hold the data that define the vertices in a mesh. Buffers also store the
---  vertex indices of a mesh, which define the order the vertices are connected together into
---  triangles. These are often called vertex buffers and index buffers.
---- Shader data: Buffers can be bound to a Shader, letting the Shader read arbitrary data. For
---  example, Lua code could create a Buffer with the positions and colors of all the lights in a
---  scene, which a Shader can use to do lighting calculations.
---- Compute: Compute shaders can write data to Buffers.
---
---This GPU-generated data can be used in
---  later rendering work or sent back to Lua.
---- Indirect: Indirect rendering is an advanced technique where instructions for rendering work
---  are recorded to a Buffer (potentially by a compute shader) and later drawn.
---
---There are two types of Buffers:
---
---- **Temporary** buffers are very inexpensive to create, and writing to them from Lua is fast.
---  However, they become invalid at the end of `lovr.draw` (i.e. when `lovr.graphics.submit` is
---  called).
---
---The GPU is slightly slower at accessing data from temporary buffers, and compute
---  shaders can not write to them.
---
---They are designed for storing data that changes every frame.
---- **Permanent** buffers are more expensive to create, and updating their contents requires a
---  transfer from CPU memory to VRAM.
---
---They act like normal LÃ–VR objects and don't need to be
---  recreated every frame.
---
---They often have faster performance when used by the GPU, and compute
---  shaders can write to them.
---
---They are great for large pieces of data that are initialized once
---  at load time, or data that is updated infrequently.
---
---@class lovr.Buffer
local Buffer = {}

---
---Clears some or all of the data in the Buffer to zero.
---
---This is supported for both temporary and permanent Buffers.
---
---Permanent Buffers can also be cleared in a transfer pass using `Pass:clear`.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---Clearing a permanent buffer requires the byte offset and byte count of the cleared range to be a multiple of 4.
---
---This will usually be true for most field types.
---
---@param index? number # The index of the first item to clear.
---@param count? number # The number of items to clear.  If `nil`, clears as many items as possible.
function Buffer:clear(index, count) end

---Returns the format of the Buffer.

---
---@return number length # The length of the Buffer.
function Buffer:getLength() end

---
---Returns a raw pointer to the Buffer's memory as a lightuserdata, intended for use with the LuaJIT ffi or for passing to C libraries.
---
---This is only available for temporary buffers, and as such the pointer is only valid until `lovr.graphics.submit` is called.
---
---@return lightuserdata pointer # A pointer to the Buffer's memory.
function Buffer:getPointer() end

---
---Returns the size of the Buffer, in bytes.
---
---This is the same as `length * stride`.
---
---@return number size # The size of the Buffer, in bytes.
function Buffer:getSize() end

---
---Returns the distance between each item in the Buffer, in bytes.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---When a Buffer is created, the stride can be set explicitly, otherwise it will be automatically computed based on the fields in the Buffer.
---
---Strides can not be zero, and can not be smaller than the size of a single item.
---
---To work around this, bind the Buffer as a storage buffer and fetch data from the buffer manually.
---
---@return number stride # The stride of the Buffer, in bytes.
function Buffer:getStride() end

---
---Returns whether the Buffer is temporary.
---
---@return boolean temporary # Whether the Buffer is temporary.
function Buffer:isTemporary() end

---
---Changes data in the Buffer using a table or a Blob.
---
---This is supported for both temporary and permanent buffers.
---
---All passes submitted to the GPU will use the new data.
---
---It is also possible to change the data in permanent buffers inside of a transfer pass using `Pass:copy`.
---
---Using a transfer pass allows the copy to happen after other passes in the frame.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---When using a table, the table can contain a nested table for each value in the Buffer, or it can be a flat list of field component values.
---
---It is not possible to mix both nested tables and flat values.
---
---For each item updated, components of each field in the item (according to the Buffer's format) are read from either the nested subtable or the table itself.
---
---A single number can be used to update a field with a scalar type.
---
---Multiple numbers or a `lovr.math` vector can be used to update a field with a vector or mat4 type.
---
---Multiple numbers can be used to update mat2 and mat3 fields.
---
---When updating normalized field types, components read from the table will be clamped to the normalized range ([0,1] or [-1,1]).
---
---In the Buffer, each field is written at its byte offset according to the Buffer's format, and subsequent items are separated by the byte stride of the Buffer.
---
---Any missing components for an updated field will be set to zero.

---
---Textures are multidimensional blocks of memory on the GPU, contrasted with `Buffer`s which are similar but one-dimensional.
---
---Textures can be used to provide material data to Shaders, and they are also used as the destination for rendering operations.
---
---Textures can be created from image filenames, `Image` objects, or they can be left blank and created with a width, height, and depth.
---
---Each Texture has a type (`TextureType`).
---
---2D Textures are the most common and are often used to store color image data, but there are also cubemaps for skyboxes, 3D textures for volumetric info, and array textures which store a sequence of 2D images.
---
---The format of a Texture (`TextureFormat`) defines the size and number of channels of each pixel.
---
---Textures can have mipmaps, which are a precomputed set of progressively smaller versions of the Texture.
---
---Mipmaps help make the Texture look smoother at smaller sizes, and also improve the performance of reading data from the Texture in a Shader.
---
---When used as a render target, the Texture can store multiple different color samples for each pixel, which can be averaged together after rendering to do antialiasing (this is called multisample antialiasing, or MSAA).
---
---It is possible to create multiple views of a single Texture.
---
---A texture view references a subset of the array layers and mipmap levels of its parent texture, and can be bound to a Shader or used as a render target just like a normal texture.
---
---@class lovr.Texture
local Texture = {}

---
---Returns the height of the Texture, in pixels.
---
---@return number height # The height of the Texture, in pixels.
function Texture:getHeight() end

---
---Returns the layer count of the Texture.
---
---2D textures always have 1 layer and cubemaps always have 6 layers.
---
---For 3D and array textures, this is the number of images stored in the texture. 3D textures represent a spatial 3D volume, whereas array textures are multiple layers of distinct 2D images.
---
---@return number layers # The layer count of the Texture.
function Texture:getLayerCount() end

---
---Returns the number of mipmap levels in the Texture.
---
---This is set when the Texture is created. By default, textures are created with a full set of mipmap levels, and mipmaps are generated if the images used to create the texture do not include mipmaps.
---
---
---### NOTE:
---Each mipmap level will be half the size of the previous (larger) mipmap level, down to a single pixel.
---
---This means the maximum number of mipmap levels is given by `log2(max(width, height))` for non-3D textures and `log2(max(width, height, depth))` for 3D textures.
---
---@return number mipmaps # The number of mipmap levels in the Texture.

function Texture:getParent() end

---
---Returns the number of multisample antialiasing (MSAA) samples in the Texture.
---
---Multisampling is used for antialiasing when rendering to the Texture.
---
---Using more samples will cause the Texture to use additional memory but reduce aliasing artifacts.
---

---
---@return number width # The width of the Texture, in pixels.
function Texture:getWidth() end

---
---Returns whether a Texture was created with a set of `TextureUsage` flags.
---
---Usage flags are specified when the Texture is created, and restrict what you can do with a Texture object.
---
---By default, only the `sample` usage is enabled.
---
---Applying a smaller set of usage flags helps LÃ–VR optimize things better.
---
---@vararg lovr.TextureUsage # One or more usage flags.
---@return boolean supported # Whether the Texture has all the provided usage flags.
function Texture:hasUsage(...) end

---
---Returns whether a Texture is a texture view, created with `Texture:newView`.
---
---@return boolean view # Whether the Texture is a texture view.
function Texture:isView() end

---
---Creates a new Texture view.
---
---A texture view does not store any pixels on its own, but instead uses the pixel data of a "parent" Texture object.
---
---The width, height, format, sample count, and usage flags all match the parent.
---
---The view may have a different `TextureType` from the parent, and it may reference a subset of the parent texture's images and mipmap levels.
---
---Texture views can be used as render targets in a render pass and they can be bound to Shaders. They can not currently be used for transfer operations.
---
---They are used for:
---
---- Reinterpretation of texture contents.
---
---For example, a cubemap can be treated as
---  an array texture.
---- Rendering to a particular image or mipmap level of a texture.
---- Binding a particular image or mipmap level to a shader.
---
---@param parent lovr.Texture # The parent Texture to create the view of.

---
---The different ways to pack Buffer fields into memory.
---
---The default is `packed`, which is suitable for vertex buffers and index buffers.
---
---It doesn't add any padding between elements, and so it doesn't waste any space.
---
---However, this layout won't necessarily work for uniform buffers and storage buffers.
---
---The `std140` layout corresponds to the std140 layout used for uniform buffers in GLSL.
---
---It adds the most padding between fields, and requires the stride to be a multiple of 16.
---
---Example:
---
---``` layout(std140) uniform ObjectScales { float scales[64]; }; ```
---
---The `std430` layout corresponds to the std430 layout used for storage buffers in GLSL.
---
---It adds some padding between certain types, and may round up the stride.
---
---Example:
---
---``` layout(std430) buffer TileSizes { vec2 sizes[]; } ```
---
---@alias lovr.BufferLayout
---
---The packed layout, without any padding.
---
---| "packed"
---
---The std140 layout.
---
---| "std140"
---
---The std430 layout.
---
---| "std430"

---
---Different types for `Buffer` fields.
---
---These are scalar, vector, or matrix types, usually packed into small amounts of space to reduce the amount of memory they occupy.
---
---The names are encoded as follows:
---
---- The data type:
---  - `i` for signed integer
---  - `u` for unsigned integer
---  - `sn` for signed normalized (-1 to 1)
---  - `un` for unsigned normalized (0 to 1)
---  - `f` for floating point
---- The bit depth of each component
---- The letter `x` followed by the component count (for vectors)
---
---
---### NOTE:
---In addition to these values, the following aliases can be used:
---
---<table>
---  <thead>
---    <tr>
---      <td>Alias</td>
---      <td>Maps to</td>
---    </tr>
---  </thead>
---  <tbody>

---    <tr>
---      <td><code>color</code></td>
---      <td><code>un8x4</code></td>
---    </tr>
---  </tbody> </table>
---
---Additionally, the following convenience rules apply:
---
---- Field types can end in an `s`, which will be stripped off.
---- Field types can end in `x1`, which will be stripped off.
---
---So you can write, e.g. `lovr.graphics.newBuffer(4, 'floats')`, which is cute!

---
---These are the different ways `Texture` objects can be used.
---
---These are passed in to `lovr.graphics.isFormatSupported` to see which texture operations are supported by the GPU for a given format.
---
---@alias lovr.TextureFeature
---
---The Texture can be sampled (e.g. a `texture2D` or `sampler2D` variable in shaders).
---
---| "sample"
---
---The Texture can be used with a `Sampler` using a `FilterMode` of `linear`.
---
---| "filter"
---
---The Texture can be rendered to by using it as a target in a render `Pass`.
---
---| "render"
---
---Blending can be enabled when rendering to this format in a render pass.
---
---| "blend"
---
---The Texture can be sent to an image variable in shaders (e.g. `image2D`).
---
---| "storage"
---
---Atomic operations can be used on storage textures with this format.

---
---Different types of textures.
---
---Textures are multidimensional blocks of GPU memory, and the texture's type determines how many dimensions there are, and adds some semantics about what the 3rd dimension means.
---
---@alias lovr.TextureType
---
---A single 2D image, the most common type.
---
---| "2d"
---
---A 3D image, where a sequence of 2D images defines a 3D volume.
---
---Each mipmap level of a 3D texture gets smaller in the x, y, and z axes, unlike cubemap and array textures.
---
---| "3d"
---
---Six 2D images that define the faces of a cubemap, used for skyboxes or other "directional" images.
---
---| "cube"
---
---Array textures are sequences of distinct 2D images.
---
---| "array"

---
---These are the different things `Texture`s can be used for.
---
---When creating a Texture, a set of these flags can be provided, restricting what operations are allowed on the texture.
---
---Using a smaller set of flags may improve performance.
---
---If none are provided, the only usage flag applied is `sample`.
---
---@alias lovr.TextureUsage
---
---Whether the texture can be sampled from in Shaders (i.e. used in a material, or bound to a variable with a `texture` type, like `texture2D`).
---
---| "sample"
---
---Whether the texture can be rendered to (i.e. by using it as a render target in `lovr.graphics.pass`).
---
---| "render"
---
---Whether the texture can be used as a storage texture for compute operations (i.e. bound to a variable with an `image` type, like `image2D`).
